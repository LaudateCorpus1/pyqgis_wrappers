parfait
=======

parfait is a wrapper around common pyqgis idioms that allows for faster development and some of the (sometimes) ugly C based API (read: not Python-ish)

The current plan is to flesh out ideas using parfait and then mirgate them to core QGIS as they become stable or well designed.

What the heck is a Parfait
